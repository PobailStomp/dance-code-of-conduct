# Information
This repository contains the text for an open source code of conduct intended for partner dance events, and was originally adapted from the code of conduct for [Fair City Blues](http://faircityblues.com/code.html), which was in turn inspired by other events. The intent behind this project is to create a code of conduct anyone can use for their dance events, with multiple people collaborating on a single document as a unified front instead of having multiple variations across scenes.

As a result, readers are encouraged to create issues or pull requests for any part of the code they think could be improved. The code may need to be slightly modified from place to place, as some countries (or states) may have mandatory reporting for event organisers or venues if a crime is committed - if in doubt, check with your local law enforcement.

# Implementation
The following is a list of events and or organisers that use or have used this code of conduct. The best place to display it is as a laminated printout at the event registration/sign-in desk, though codes of conduct are commonly given their own page on an organisations' website. An alternate option is as a note on a facebook page, which has the added benefit of allowing people to comment on it and ask questions.
