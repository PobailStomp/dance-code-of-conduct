# Introduction
This is an open source code of conduct intended for partnered dance events.  

It was originally adapted from the code of conduct for [Fair City Blues](http://faircityblues.com/code.html), which was in turn inspired by other events. 

* [English](/pdf/2023-coc-english.pdf)
* [Italian](/pdf/2023-coc-italian.pdf)
* [Spanish](/pdf/2023-coc-spanish.pdf)

The intent for for the project is to create a code of conduct anyone can use for their dance events, with multiple collaborators working to improve a single document as a unified front for a local dance scene.

If you have improvements, you can file [issues through GitHub](https://github.com/PobailStomp/dance-code-of-conduct/issues).

The code may need to be modified from scene to scene, as some locales may have mandatory reporting for event organisers or venues if a crime is committed.

If in doubt, check with your local law enforcement.
