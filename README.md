# Information
This repository contains the text for an open source code of conduct intended for partner dance events, and was originally adapted from the code of conduct for [Fair City Blues](http://faircityblues.com/code.html), which was in turn inspired by other events. The intent behind this project is to create a code of conduct anyone can use for their dance events, with multiple people collaborating on a single document as a unified front instead of having multiple variations across scenes.

As a result, readers are encouraged to create issues or pull requests for any part of the code they think could be improved. The code may need to be slightly modified from place to place, as some countries (or states) may have mandatory reporting for event organisers or venues if a crime is committed - if in doubt, check with your local law enforcement.

See [here](https://github.com/ADubhlaoich/dance-code-of-conduct/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for a list of events and organisers that have adopted the code.

# Code of Conduct
Our events are social and learning experiences where we want people to feel comfortable, and we aim to provide a harassment-free and safe social dance experience for everyone regardless of dance ability or background, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other characteristic.

We take zero tolerance to harassment in any form: individuals violating these rules may be warned or expelled from the venue at the discretion of the organisers. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any of the event organisers immediately. Ask the sign-in/registration desk if you need assistance locating an organiser.

Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, harassing or intrusive 
photography or videography, inappropriate physical contact (including unsolicited affection), sexual imagery in public spaces, and unwelcome and unreciprocated sexual attention. When asked to stop any harassing behaviour, participants are expected to comply immediately.

Unsafe behaviour includes, but is not limited to, dipping too deeply or without permission; forceful, or "yanking" movements that could cause injury to your partner, excessive use of alcohol, and any form of aerials/air steps without explicit consent, or on a social floor (i.e. outside of a performance or jam circle). It is perfectly acceptable to say no to a dance without reason.

We expect all dancers to do their best to avoid collisions on the dance floor, to apologise if and when such collisions occur, and to ensure that all dancers are all right before continuing dancing. Additionally we expect that dancers to not interfere with others, except when given consent (e.g. in a steal or swapping, or switch dance). 

## Breaches

Any individual breaching this code of conduct at an event may expect (depending on the severity): 

* A verbal warning from an organiser, advising them to change their behaviour
* A formal warning from an organiser, stating that any further breaches will be grounds for further action
* Ejection from an individual event (e.g. dance, class etc) or overall event (e.g. dance weekend)
* Banning from this and all future events run by the organisers
* Reporting of their actions to the legal authorities

Any action taken is at the discretion of the event organisers.

## Issue Reporting
If you experience or witness a breach of this code of conduct, the following is what you can expect when you notify an organiser. If you do not initially want action taken, but later change your mind, do not hesitate to contact an organiser. 

* An organiser will talk you privately in confidence.
* The organiser will then document the issue.
* They will then ask you how you would like the situation to be handled.
* Action will be taken against the individual(s) involved, in line with those listed in the "Breaches" section.

We appreciate your assistance in keeping our events as safe as possible for everyone.
